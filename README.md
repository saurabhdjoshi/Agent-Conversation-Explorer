# Agent Conversation Explorer

A local dev tool for browsing and debugging live agent conversations via [Azure Application Insights](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/app-insights-overview) telemetry. Built with React + TypeScript + Vite; not deployed anywhere.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 20+
- [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) — used to obtain App Insights bearer tokens
- Access to an Azure Application Insights resource that receives your agent's telemetry
- (Copilot Studio) If configuring a Copilot Studio agent to send telemetry, follow Microsoft's guide for connecting Copilot Studio agents to Application Insights: [Connect your Copilot Studio agent to Application Insights](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot-studio/advanced-bot-framework-composer-capture-telemetry#connect-your-copilot-studio-agent-to-application-insights)

## Setup

**1. Install dependencies**

```bash
npm install
```

**2. Configure environment**

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill in the connection string:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `TELEMETRY_CONNECTION_STRING` | Azure portal → App Insights resource → Properties → Connection String |
| `LOG_PATH` | Optional. Folder where the server writes daily log files (default: `./logs`). |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | Optional. Minimum log level (`debug` \| `info` \| `warn` \| `error`). Default: `info`. |

**3. Run the app**

```bash
npm run dev
```

Opens the app at **http://localhost:3000**. The Express API proxy starts on port 3001.

## Settings

Click the **⚙ Settings** button in the top-right corner to manage all configuration from within the app.

### Security

**Azure login** — Sign in to Azure using the device code flow without leaving the app. Click **Login with Azure**, open the URL shown, enter the code, and the app detects sign-in automatically. Once authenticated, use **Switch Account** to change identities or **Refresh** to re-check status.

**Connection String** — Paste or update your App Insights connection string. Use **Test Connection** to verify the current Azure identity has access to the resource before saving. Changes take effect immediately — no server restart needed.

### Logging

**Log Level** — Controls the minimum severity written to disk (`debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`).

**Log Path** — Click **Browse…** to select a local folder using the native folder picker. The server creates the folder if it doesn't exist and writes daily rotated log files (`app-YYYY-MM-DD.log`) inside it. Requires server restart to take effect.

### Theme

Switch between **Midnight** (dark) and **Sand Beach** (light). The preference persists across sessions.

## Status footer

A slim status bar at the bottom of the app shows the current Azure sign-in state (green/red dot), account name, subscription, tenant, and the active App Insights resource. It updates immediately when you sign in or out via Settings.

## Local logging

The server writes structured JSON logs to a daily rotated file alongside printing to the console. Configure via `.env.local` or the Settings panel:

- `LOG_PATH` — folder where log files are written (default: `./logs`). Today's file is `{LOG_PATH}/app-YYYY-MM-DD.log`.
- `LOG_LEVEL` — minimum level to persist (`debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`). Default: `info`.

Retention/pruning of old log files is not implemented; add a pruning policy if you need to limit disk usage.

Example log entry (one JSON object per line):

```json
{"timestamp":"2026-06-15T23:00:00.123Z","level":"error","message":"Failed to query App Insights","meta":{"stack":"Error: ...","conversationId":"abc123","phone":"***"}}
```

> Client-side console output is forwarded to the server in development and persisted alongside server logs. Sensitive fields (tokens, phone numbers) are masked automatically.

## What It Does

The sidebar lists recent conversations pulled from App Insights. Click any row to explore it in detail across three tabs:

**Chat** — Renders the full conversation as message bubbles. Bot messages show text (T) and voice (S) channels separately. AI-generated responses are badged.

**Execution Path** — Shows the topic flow as a collapsible tree. Each topic node lists its actions with Kind, ActionId, timestamps, and key context fields. Expand any action for the full raw JSON. Outbound dependency calls (connector invocations, HTTP requests, Power Automate flows) are surfaced inline as green cards with target, duration, and status code — pulled from the App Insights `dependencies` table and correlated by `operation_Id`. Interrupted topics (where a topic started but did not complete normally) are classified and labelled: *overridden*, *empty*, *incomplete*, or *tool* (a connector/flow invocation). Developer events emitted via `LogCustomTelemetryEvent` are rendered as named rows with their full custom fields.

**Errors** — Lists all `OnErrorLog` events with their `customDimensions` payload. Each error links back to the relevant step in the Execution Path tab.

### Filters

The sidebar supports:
- Free-text search across conversation ID and topic names
- Phone number filter
- Channel filter (Omnichannel / IVR)
- Agent filter (multi-select)
- Time range (15 minutes → 30 days)
- Outcome filter (all / completed / transferred / escalated / errored / abandoned)

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. See CONTRIBUTING.md at the repository root for complete contribution guidelines, including issue templates, PR checklist, commit message conventions, and the development setup.

Quick start

1. Fork the repo and create a branch from `main` using the naming convention `<type>/<short-description>` (e.g. `fix/filter-reset-on-nav` or `feat/export-conversation`).
2. Follow the [Setup](#setup) steps to run the app locally.
3. Keep changes focused; run `npm run build` (type-check + Vite build) before opening a PR.
4. Open a pull request against `main` with a concise description, verification steps, and screenshots for UI changes.

Review process (summary)

- CI runs `npm run build` on every PR; the build must pass before review.
- One approval from a code owner required.
- Squash merge only; contributor branches are deleted after merge.

For bug reports, include reproduction steps, browser console output, and any server errors from `npm run dev`.
